# ConsenSource Transaction Processor

The transaction processor contains the business logic for ConsenSource's certificate registry [transaction family](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/app_developers_guide/overview.html). It implements the [Sawtooth processor class](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/docs/core/releases/latest/_autogen/sdk_TP_tutorial_js.html) allowing developers to write out application-specific code for handling certificate registry transactions (or really any family of transactions).

For more information, please read through the [Transaction Processor & Families](https://target.github.io/consensource-docs/docs/developer/application-developers-guide/tp/transaction-processor-and-famlies/) docs.
